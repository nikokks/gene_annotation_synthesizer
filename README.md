Gene annotation synthesizer

This project aims to synthesize gene names from their sequences and / or GO/Interpro/Pfam annotations and other metadata.
The dataset used is parsed from the full trEMBL XML file sourced from uniprot.
The original (160GB compressed) xml file can be found at: https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/knowledgebase/complete/

# TODO:

* Augment data by copying records w/ multiple gene names
* Feature engineering on aa sequences
* Find ways to compute on full dataset (postgreSQL ?)
